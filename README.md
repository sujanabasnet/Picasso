# Picasso

An application that allows the user to create expressions that
evaluate to colors and then eventually to images.

The given code base is a good start, but it is sparsely documented
(document each method/part after you understand what it's doing) and,
as your application grows, you may need to refactor.

See the specification for Picasso on the course web site

## Project Organization

`src` - the source code for the project

`conf` - the configuration files for the project

The `images` directory contains some sample images generated from Picasso.  Some of the expressions for these images can be found in the `expressions` directory.

Within our `expressions` directory we contain the following functions: Absolute Value(Abs), ArcTangent(Atan), Ceil, Clamp, Cos, Exponetial(Exp), Floor, ImageWrap, Log, PerlinBW, PerlinColor, Randomizer, Rgbtoycrcb, Sin, Tan, Wrap, and Ycrcbtorgb

Within our `expressions` directory we contain the following operators: Addition, Division, Exponentiate, Modulo(Mod), Multiplication, and Subtraction.
